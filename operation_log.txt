Description: The image depicts two orca whales in mid-air, performing a leap over the ocean. The orcas are captured in a dynamic pose, with their bodies angled upwards and their tails and fins spread out, indicating movement and energy. The ocean beneath them is a deep blue, and the sky above is a clear, bright blue, suggesting a sunny day. In the background, there are snow-capped mountains, which provide a contrasting backdrop to the vibrant marine life in the foreground. The overall scene conveys a sense of freedom and power, as the orcas seem to be enjoying their time in the open water.
